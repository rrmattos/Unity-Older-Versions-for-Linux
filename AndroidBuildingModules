Apparently when we install a Unity version, outside the Unity Hub, we won't be able to install the SDK, NDK and JDK modules 
for Android.
So, I compressed the Android folder with the modules to make our lifes easier hahah (via google drive - the file have 1.5GB):

For installation, all do you need it's find the folder's path in your engine's folder (this process need to be done for each 
different version), make a backup of the original "AndroidPlayer" folder (if you want), and then replace the folder with 
that one on the drive.

I used it on a 2019.x version of Unity, so I don't know if the same files work on another versions.

In Ubuntu, the path is "/home/your_user/Unity/engine_version_folder/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines"
