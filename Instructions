If you haven't found the older version that you need, try the following steps:

On the "Download Archive" page of UnityEngine, find the version you want and right click on the green "Unity Hub" button. 
Then, copy the URL link. Should be something like:

" unityhub://2019.2.21f1/9d528d026557 "



Now, you have to do some editings. First, write on the URL the address " http://beta.unity3d.com/download/ " and after "/download/" insert the key "9d528d026557", 
add a slash "/", then write "UnitySetup-" and finally add the version "2019.2.21.f1". (note: the key and the version was copied from the link in Unity Hub button)
The result will be:

" http://beta.unity3d.com/download/9d528d026557/UnitySetup-2019.2.21f1 "



Press "Enter", download the file, modify the extension for ".appimage" (in case it's not an appimage already), 
give the permissions and "voil√†"!

I've the Ubuntu 19.10 installed, so maybe changing the extension file like this could not work in a different OS...
